# 👋 Hey there, I'm Rafail Palalakis

🎓 **Informatics & Electronics Engineering undergraduate - I.H.U** (starting October 2025) passionate about building clean, minimal, and interactive applications.

### 💻 What I Do
I focus on connecting **modern UI/UX** with **functional application logic**, using:
- 🐍 **Python (PyQt / WebEngine)** – creating desktop apps with web-based interfaces  
- 🌐 **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** – crafting responsive and minimal web desings  
- 🧠 **UI/UX Prototyping** – designing layouts in **Figma** before implementing them in code  

I enjoy experimenting with **hybrid app structures**, where HTML/CSS interfaces interact seamlessly with Python backends for dynamic, cross-platform experiences.

### 🧩 Other Interests
Beyond coding, I explore:
- 🎨 **3D graphics and game development** using **Blender**  
- 🕹️ Integrating **art, code, and interactivity** into cohesive experiences  

🏆 My school team earned **3rd place** in the *Panhellenic “Hack the Art: Γιανούλης Χαλεπάς”* competition (3D Games category) (a project that combined storytelling, game design, and technical artistry).

### 🚀 Currently Exploring
- Building **cross-platform apps** that merge desktop and web technologies  
- Improving my **networking and hardware** knowledge  
- Expanding my **software design workflow** from concept → prototype → app
